	This file is not needed. I just wanted to see what would happen if we also had an XML config file in the same project as the JSON config file.
	Normally these appSettings and connectionStrings would be available in the ConfigurationManager object, except when we load the JSON config data
	into the ConfigurationManager object we first clear the appSettings and connectionStrings collections, removing any entries defined in this file.

	<connectionStrings>
		<add name="MyConnectionString" connectionString="XmlConnectionStringInNet8" />
